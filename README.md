 
 # ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning & Business Statistics Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on cleaning messy manufacturing datasets and applying statistical tests to answer business-related questions.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Fixed incorrect date formats
   - Handled missing values (median imputation)
   - Treated outliers using IQR + normality test

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms & Boxplots for numeric features
   - Correlation & Regression plots

3. **Business Questions Answered**
   - âœ… Are gadget parts meeting the 50mm length specification? *(Z-Test)*
   - âœ… Do defect rates differ between morning vs. night shifts? *(Chi-square Test)*
   - âœ… Which material type yields the highest average BatchYield%? *(ANOVA)*
   - âœ… Do more experienced operators produce fewer defects? *(T-Test)*
   - âœ… Are suppliers with lower QualityScore linked to higher defect counts? *(Correlation & Regression)*

## ðŸ“Š Example Insights
- Mean gadget length is statistically different from the 50mm target.
- Morning vs Night shifts showed significant difference in defect rates.
- MaterialType C yields the highest BatchYield%.
- Experienced operators produce fewer defects.
- Negative correlation between supplier QualityScore and defect counts.
